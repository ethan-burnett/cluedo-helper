# cluedo-helper
This application intents to help and simplify player experience in the board game Cluedo.  

`cluedo-helper` works as a substitute for writing down rumours and logic on paper. Once started the player is presented with a setup screen, here they state who and how many players are involved.  
They are then directed to the main screen where a table is presented on the left showing each card and player status. On the right are action buttons to view past rumours, add new rumours, assign cards and move to the next player's turn. Below these actions are all the currently known properties of the players.  

The table and player properties/statuses will update throughout the game. Begin by assigning your cards to yourself. Followed by the first rumour by player 1.
